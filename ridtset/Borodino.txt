Mikhail Lermontov
Borodino
– Hey tell, old man, had we a cause
When Moscow, razed by fire, once was
        Given up to Frenchman's blow?
Old-timers talk about some frays,
And they remember well those days!
With cause all Russia fashions lays
        About Borodino!

– Yea, were there men when I was young,
Whose songs your tribe is not to 've sung:
        They'd fight, – you 're none as good!
An evil lot have they been drawn:
Few left the grounds to which they had gone...
Had it not been God's will alone,
        Old Moscow should have stood!
