Mikhail Lermontov
Borodino
Tell, uncle, it was not a boon
By fire Moscow burnt so soon
Enjoyed by Frenchmen tall?
Fierce fights... or wasn't there any?
There were, great battles, there were many,
For reason Russians, kids and granny,
This glorious day recall!

Once was a folk that you could face
So much unlike the present race
Top gun - you're not so good!
Bad fate they had on their shields
Just few made their way from fields
But for God's will, unless He dealed,
Old Moscow would have stood!
